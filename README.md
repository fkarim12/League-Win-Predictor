# An Introduction to Data Science through League of Legends
## by: Faraz Karim, Sky Cen, Devin Moon

League of Legends is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) that was developed and released by Riot Games in 2009. The standard game mode consists of two teams, five players on each team, that fight to destroy the other team's nexus (base). Each player controls a champion (character) which each have their own unique sets of abilities. Along the way, teams can fight neutral objectives to gain powerups and other rewards in order to make their champions stronger as the game progresses.

There may be many terms that are not familiar to those who have not played League of Legends. We have provided a list of terms with their definitions in order to make the tutorial clearer.

Summoner: A player that is playing the game and controlling their character i.e player

Champion: The character that a player can control. There are many different champions in the game with many different abilities.

KDA: Kill Death Assists or KDA for short in the ratio of a participant's Kills and Assists per Death they have. (Kills + Assists) / Deaths

Ward: An item that provides vision to a certain portion of the map. The item can be synonymous to a "torch" that provides light in a dark area.

We chose League of Legends as the focus of our project because there are many different variables and factors that could influence the outcome of the game. That being said, we are not limited to just analyzing the outcome of a game. We can also observe how two completely different variables may or may not be correlated with each other. We aim to find trends with different variables that could determine different outcomes of a game using exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing and different machine learning models. By following along with our tutorial, we hope that those new to data science can gain a basic understanding of how data science can be conducted using tools such as various Python libraries.
